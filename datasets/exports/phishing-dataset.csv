The problem i have with it is you HAVE the time to clean it, but you choose not to. You skype, you take pictures, you sleep, you want to go out. I don't mind a few things here and there, but when you don't make the bed, when you throw laundry on top of it, when i can't have a friend in the house because i'm embarassed that there's underwear and bras strewn on the bed, pillows on the floor, that's something else. You used to be good about at least making the bed."

Sehr geehrter Kunde!
Wir sind erfreut, Ihnen mitzuteilen, dass Internet - Ueberweisungen ueber unsere Bank noch sicherer geworden sind!
Leider wurde von uns in der letzten Zeit, trotz der Anwendung von den TAN-Codes, eine ganze Reihe der Mitteldiebstaehle von den Konten unserer Kunden durch den Internetzugriff festgestellt.
Zur Zeit kennen wir die Methodik nicht, die die Missetaeter fuer die Entwendung der Angaben aus den TAN - Tabellen verwenden. Um die Missetaeter zu ermitteln und die Geldmittel von unseren Kunden unversehrt zu erhalten, haben wir entschieden, aus den TAN - Tabellen von unseren Kunden zwei aufeinanderfolgenden Codes zu entfernen.
Dafuer muessen Sie unsere Seite besuchen, wo Ihnen angeboten wird, eine spezielle Form auszufuellen. In dieser Form werden Sie ZWEI FOLGENDE TAN - CODEs, DIE SIE NOCH NICHT VERWENDET HABEN, EINTASTEN.

Achtung! Verwenden Sie diese zwei Codes in der Zukunft nicht mehr!
Wenn bei der Mittelueberweisung von Ihrem Konto gerade diese
TAN - Codes verwendet werden, so wird es fuer uns bedeuten, dass von Ihrem Konto eine nicht genehmigte Transitaktion ablaeuft und Ihr Konto wird unverzueglich bis zur Klaerung der Zahlungsumstaende gesperrt.

Diese Massnahme dient Ihnen und Ihrem Geld zum Schutze! Wir bitten um Entschuldigung, wenn wir Ihnen die Unannehmlichkeiten bereitet haben.

eBay request: Please follow the Member Verification Procedure (Second Notice)

Dear eBay Member,

Due to recent account takeovers and unauthorized listings, eBay is introducing a new account verification method. From time to time, randomly selected accounts (seller and/or buyer) are subjected to an advanced verification process based on our merchant accounts/bank relations and customers credit card. eBay may also request in an email message scanned/faxed copies of one or more photo ID's. Your account confirmation may go wrong if your credit card/bank account is expired, or if you have changed your credit card number, billing address etc. without letting us know about the change.
Subject of this verification process are also the accounts that have unpaid dues to eBay.
Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you receive this message your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your eBay registration. If you received this notice and you are not the authorized account holder, please be aware that it is in violation of eBay policy to represent oneself as another eBay user. Such action may also be in violation of local, national, and/or international law. eBay is committed to assist law enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate personal information with the intent to commit fraud or theft. Information will be provided at the request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Subject of this verification process are also the accounts that have unpaid dues to eBay.
Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you receive this message your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your eBay registration. If you received this notice and you are not the authorized account holder, please be aware that it is in violation of eBay policy to represent oneself as another eBay user. Such action may also be in violation of local, national, and/or international law. eBay is committed to assist law enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate personal information with the intent to commit fraud or theft. Information will be provided at the request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud 
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 
require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an 
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account

features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-040-442-508

We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. 
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension.

Wir haben sehr sorgfaltig jeden Diebstahl von den Konten behandelt und haben somit eine Liste von den Merkmalen der verdachtigen Operation gemacht. 
Gegenwartig haben wir ein neues elektronisches Sicherheitssystem aufgebaut, das den Zugang zu den Bankkonten verhindert, das ist praktisch einsatzbereit. Scheint die Transaktion unsauber, so wird von dem System eine Geheimfrage gestellt.

Dear customers:

Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically review accounts.

Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw funds.

To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your username or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our verification process. You must confirm your credit card details and your billing information as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have updated your billing information on file.

Dear PayPal client,

Did you know that Unverified PayPal members have a Sending Limit?

You can send unlimited payments when you become Verified. It's easy! 

As a security measure, PayPal asks members to add and confirm ownership of a bank account. When you confirm your bank account, you become Verified. 

This process is a secure and easy way to confirm a member's identity and leads to safer transactions between buyers and sellers. 

Become Verified and help increase the security of your PayPal transactions for yourself and for everyone with whom you do business. 

You can also: 

- Fund purchases directly from your checking or savings account, in addition to using credit cards

- Shop without interruption because Verified users have no Sending Limit 

- Improve your reputation by letting others know you're a confirmed, Verified member of the PayPal community

- Send money to friends, family, and PayPal Personal Account holders

phishing,"cole833@katamail.com HSBC BANK 
Good day,

I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you  come by as a result of this mail.

I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of  Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And Fifty Thousand  United States 
Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the  officer assigned to his case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on  numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the  accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.

In mid 2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of  9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available to the security 
firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate Securities Co is a specialist  private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable 
products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the money  there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this 
transpired around 25th June 2003. In June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his 
deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France.

We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.  
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases
leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own
Investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow 
died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit.

According to practice, Corporate Securities Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the 
deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I 
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.

The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to  put together the general direction of what 
I propose. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting  instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this mans family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in 
a position to instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds  be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from Corp
 o!
rate Securities Co. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.

You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find
myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is 
from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only 
one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share the blessing. If 
you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to
inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I wouldnt you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines  are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have 
learnt from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we 
can  be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon.
 
I await your response.

Daniel Cole.

The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to  put together the general direction of what 
I propose. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting  instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this mans family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in 
a position to instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds  be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from Corp
 o!
rate Securities Co. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.

You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find
myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is 
from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only 
one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share the blessing. If 
you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to
inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I wouldnt you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines  are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have 
learnt from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we 
can  be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon.
 
I await your response.

phishing,"cole833@katamail.com HSBC BANK 
Good day,

I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you  come by as a result of this mail.

I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of  Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And Fifty Thousand  United States 
Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the  officer assigned to his case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on  numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the  accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.

In mid 2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of  9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available to the security 
firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate Securities Co is a specialist  private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable 
products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the money  there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this 
transpired around 25th June 2003. In June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his 
deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France.

We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.  
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases
leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own
Investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow 
died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit.

According to practice, Corporate Securities Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the 
deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I 
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.

I try and implement aggressive filters
(bogon/flood-blocking/nbar/URPF/anti-spoof, etc.) for my customer
networks. Yes it works for the most part but we occasionally run into
buffer/congestion issues and this is where qos comes to our rescue.

We monitor (proactive approach) our qos policies very closely because
they can possibly work against us given certain (white-list)
application-level data rate that are in use.

Iraq: The Policy Dilemma

By George Friedman 

U.S. President George W. Bush now has made it clear what his policy
on Iraq will be for the immediate future, certainly until Election
Day: He does not intend to change U.S. policy in any fundamental
way. U.S. troops will continue to be deployed in Iraq, they will
continue to carry out counterinsurgency operations, and they will
continue to train Iraqi troops to eventually take over the
operations. It is difficult to imagine that Bush believes there
will be any military solution to the situation in Iraq; therefore,
we must try to understand his reasoning in maintaining this
position. Certainly, it is not simply a political decision. Opinion
in the United States has turned against the war, and drawing down
U.S. forces and abandoning combat operations would appear to be the
politically expedient move. Thus, if it is not politics driving him
-- and assuming that the more lurid theories on the Internet
concerning Bush's motivations are as silly as they appear -- then
we have to figure out what he is doing.

Let's consider the military situation first. Bush has said that
there is no civil war in Iraq. This is in large measure a semantic
debate. In our view, it would be inaccurate to call what is going
on a ""civil war"" simply because that term implies a degree of
coherence that simply does not exist. Calling it a free-for-all
would be more accurate. It is not simply a conflict of Shi'i versus
Sunni. The Sunnis and Shia are fighting each other, and all of them
are fighting American forces. It is not altogether clear what the
Americans are supposed to be doing.

Counterinsurgency is unlike other warfare. In other warfare, the
goal is to defeat an enemy army, and civilian casualties as a
result of military operations are expected and acceptable. With
counterinsurgency operations in populated areas, however, the goal
is to distinguish the insurgents from civilians and destroy them,
with minimal civilian casualties. Counterinsurgency in populated
areas is more akin to police operations than to military
operations; U.S. troops are simultaneously engaging an enemy force
while trying to protect the population from both that force and
U.S. operations. Add to this the fact that the population is
frequently friendly to the insurgents and hostile to the Americans,
and the difficulty of the undertaking becomes clear.

Consider the following numbers. The New York Police Department
(excluding transit and park police) counts one policeman for every
216 residents. In Iraq, there is one U.S. soldier (not counting
other coalition troops) per about 185 people. Thus, numerically
speaking, U.S. forces are in a mildly better position than New York
City cops -- but then, except for occasional Saturday nights, New
York cops are not facing anything like the U.S. military is facing
in Iraq. Given that the United States is facing not one enemy but a
series of enemy organizations -- many fighting each other as well
as the Americans -- and that the American goal is to defeat these
while defending the populace, it is obvious even from these very
simplistic numbers that the U.S. force simply isn't there to impose
a settlement. 

Expectations and a Deal Unwound 

A military solution to the U.S. dilemma has not been in the cards
for several years. The purpose of military operations was to set
the stage for political negotiations. But the Americans had entered
Iraq with certain expectations. For one thing, they had believed
they would simply be embraced by Iraq's Shiite population. They
also had expected the Sunnis to submit to what appeared to be
overwhelming political force. What happened was very different.
First, the Shia welcomed the fall of Saddam Hussein, but they
hardly embraced the Americans -- they sought instead to translate
the U.S. victory over Hussein into a Shiite government. Second, the
Sunnis, in view of the U.S.-Shiite coalition and the dismemberment
of the Sunni-dominated Iraqi Army, saw that they were about to be
squeezed out of the political system and potentially crushed by the
Shia. They saw an insurgency -- which had been planned by Hussein
-- as their only hope of forcing a redefinition of Iraqi politics.
The Americans realized that their expectations had not been
realistic.

Thus, the Americans went through a series of political cycles.
First, they sided with the Shia as they sought to find their
balance militarily facing the Sunnis. When they felt they had
traction against the Sunnis, following the capture of Hussein --
and fearing Shiite hegemony -- they shifted toward a position
between Sunnis and Shia. As military operations were waged in the
background, complex repositioning occurred on all sides, with the
Americans trying to hold the swing position between Sunnis and
Shia. 

The process of creating a government for Iraq was encapsulated in
this multi-sided maneuvering. By spring 2006, the Sunnis appeared
to have committed themselves to the political process. And  in June
, with the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and the announcement that
the United States would  reduce its force  in Iraq by two brigades,
the stage seemed to be set for a political resolution that would
create a Shiite-dominated coalition that included Sunnis and Kurds.
It appeared to be a done deal -- and then the deal completely
collapsed.

The first sign of the collapse was a sudden outbreak of  fighting
among Shia  in the Basra region. We assumed that this was political
positioning among Shiite factions as they prepared for a political
settlement. Then Abdel Aziz al-Hakim, the head of the Supreme
Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), traveled to Tehran,
and Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army commenced an offensive. Shiite
death squads struck out at Sunni populations, and Sunni insurgents
struck back. From nearly having a political accommodation, the
situation in Iraq fell completely apart. 

The key was Iran. The Iranians had always wanted an Iraqi satellite
state, as protection against another Iraq-Iran war. That was a
basic national security concept for them. In order to have this,
the Iranians needed an overwhelmingly Shiite-dominated government
in Baghdad, and to have overwhelming control of the Shia. It seemed
to us that there could be a Shiite-dominated government but not an
overwhelmingly Shiite government. In other words, Iraq could be
neutral toward, but not a satellite of, Iran. In our view, Iraq's
leading Shia -- fearing a civil war and also being wary of
domination by Iran -- would accept this settlement. 

We may have been correct on the sentiment of leading Shia, but we
were wrong about Iran's intentions. Tehran did not see a neutral
Iraq as being either in Iran's interests or necessary. Clearly, the
Iranians did not trust a neutral Iraq still under American
occupation to remain neutral. Second -- and this is the most
important -- they saw the Americans as militarily weak and
incapable of either containing a civil war in Iraq or of taking
significant military action against Iran. In other words, the
Iranians didn't like the deal they had been offered, they felt that
they could do better, and they felt that the time had come to
strike.

A Two-Pronged Offensive 

When we look back through Iranian eyes, we can now see what they
saw: a golden opportunity to deal the United States a blow,
redefine the geopolitics of the Persian Gulf and reposition the
Shia in the Muslim world. Iran had, for example, been revivifying
Hezbollah in Lebanon for several months. We had seen this as a
routine response to the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
It is now apparent, however, that it was part of a two-pronged
offensive.

First, in Iraq, the Iranians encouraged a variety of factions to
both resist the newly formed government and to strike out against
the Sunnis. This created an uncontainable cycle of violence that
rendered the Iraqi government impotent and the Americans
irrelevant. The tempo of operations was now in the hands of those
Shiite groups among which the Iranians had extensive influence --
and this included some of the leading Shiite parties, such as
SCIRI.

Second, in Lebanon, Iran encouraged Hezbollah to launch an
offensive. There is debate over whether the Israelis or Hezbollah
ignited the conflict in Lebanon. Part of this is ideological
gibberish, but part of it concerns intention. It is clear that
Hezbollah was fully deployed for combat. Its positions were manned
in the south, and its rockets were ready. The capture of two
Israeli soldiers was intended to trigger Israeli airstrikes, which
were as predictable as sunrise, and Hezbollah was ready to fire on
Haifa. Once Haifa was hit, Israel floundered in trying to deploy
troops (the Golani and Givati brigades were in the south, near
Gaza). This would not have been the case if the Israelis had
planned for war with Hezbollah. Now, this discussion has nothing to
do with who to blame for what. It has everything to do with the
fact that Hezbollah was ready to fight, triggered the fight, and
came out ahead because it wasn't defeated.

The end result is that, suddenly, the Iranians held the whip hand
in Iraq, had dealt Israel a psychological blow, had repositioned
themselves in the Muslim world and had generally redefined the
dynamics of the region. Moreover, they had moved to the threshold
of redefining the geopolitics to the Persian Gulf. 

This was by far their most important achievement.

A New Look at the Region 

At this point, except for the United States, Iran has by far the
most powerful military force in the Persian Gulf. This has nothing
to do with its nuclear capability, which is still years away from
realization. Its ground forces are simply more numerous and more
capable than all the forces of the Arabian Peninsula combined.
There is another aspect to this: The countries of the Arabian
Peninsula are governed by Sunnis, but many are home to substantial
Shiite populations as well. Between the Iranian military and the
possibility of unrest among Shia in the region, the situation in
Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Peninsula is uneasy, to say the
least. The rise of Hezbollah well might psychologically empower the
generally quiescent Shia to become more assertive. This is one of
the reasons that the Saudis were so angry at Hezbollah, and why
they now are so anxious over events in Iraq.

If Iraq were to break into three regions, the southern region would
be Shiite -- and the Iranians clearly believe that they could
dominate southern Iraq. This not only would give them control of
the Basra oil fields, but also would theoretically open the road to
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. From a strictly military point of view,
and not including the Shiite insurgencies at all, Iran could move
far down the western littoral of the Persian Gulf if American
forces were absent. Put another way, there would be a possibility
that the Iranians could seize control of the bulk of the region's
oil reserves. They could do the same thing if Iraq were to be
united as an Iranian satellite, but that would be far more
difficult to achieve and would require active U.S. cooperation in
withdrawing.

We can now see why Bush cannot begin withdrawing forces. If he did
that, the entire region would destabilize. The countries of the
Arabian Peninsula, seeing the withdrawal, would realize that the
Iranians were now the dominant power. Shia in the Gulf region might
act, or they might simply wait until the Americans had withdrawn
and the Iranians arrived. Israel, shaken to the core by its fight
with Hezbollah, would have neither the force nor the inclination to
act. Therefore, the United States has little choice, from Bush's
perspective, but to remain in Iraq.

The Iranians undoubtedly anticipated this response. They have
planned carefully. They are therefore shifting their rhetoric
somewhat to be more accommodating. They understand that to get the
United States out of Iraq -- and out of Kuwait --they will have to
engage in a complex set of negotiations. They will promise anything
-- but in the end, they will be the largest military force in the
region, and nothing else matters. Ultimately, they are counting on
the Americans to be sufficiently exhausted by their experience of
Iraq to rationalize their withdrawal -- leaving, as in Vietnam, a
graceful interval for what follows. 

Options 

Iran will do everything it can, of course, to assure that the
Americans are as exhausted as possible. The Iranians have no
incentive to allow the chaos to wind down, until at least a
political settlement with the United States is achieved. The United
States cannot permit Iranian hegemony over the Persian Gulf, nor
can it sustain its forces in Iraq indefinitely under these
circumstances. 

The United States has four choices, apart from the status quo:

1. Reach a political accommodation that cedes the status of
regional hegemon to Iran, and withdraw from Iraq. 

2. Withdraw forces from Iraq and maintain a presence in Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia -- something the Saudis would hate but would have
little choice about -- while remembering that an American military
presence is highly offensive to many Muslims and was a significant
factor in the rise of al Qaeda. 

3. Halt counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and redeploy its
forces in the south (west of Kuwait), to block any Iranian moves in
the region.

4. Assume that Iran relies solely on its psychological pre-eminence
to force a regional realignment and, thus, use Sunni proxies such
as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in attempts to outmaneuver Tehran.

None of these are attractive choices. Each cedes much of Iraq to
Shiite and Iranian power and represents some degree of a
psychological defeat for the United States, or else rests on a
risky assumption. While No. 3 might be the most attractive, it
would leave U.S. forces in highly exposed, dangerous and
difficult-to-sustain postures. 

Iran has set a clever trap, and the United States has walked into
it. Rather than a functioning government in Iraq, it has chaos and
a triumphant Shiite community. The Americans cannot contain the
chaos, and they cannot simply withdraw. Therefore, we can
understand why Bush insists on holding his position indefinitely.
He has been maneuvered in such a manner that he -- or a successor
-- has no real alternatives. 

There is one counter to this: a massive American buildup, including
a major buildup of ground forces that requires a large expansion of
the Army, geared for the invasion of Iran and destruction of its
military force. The idea that this could readily be done through
air power has evaporated, we would think, with the Israeli air
force's failure in Lebanon. An invasion of Iran would be enormously
expensive, take a very long time and create a problem of occupation
that would dwarf the problem faced in Iraq. But it is the other
option. It would stabilize the geopolitics of the Arabian Peninsula
and drain American military power for a generation.

Sometimes there are no good choices. For the United States, the
options are to negotiate a settlement that is acceptable to Iran
and live with the consequences, raise a massive army and invade
Iran, or live in the current twilight world between Iranian
hegemony and war with Iran. Bush appears to be choosing an
indecisive twilight. Given the options, it is understandable why.

 Dear Valued Customer
Bank Of America is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically review accounts.
Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw funds.
To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your username or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our verification process. You must confirm your credit card details and your billing information as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have updated your billing information on file.
To initiate the update confirmation process. Please follow the link below and fill in the necessary fields.

PayPal Internet Banking

Dear PayPal valued member,
Recently, we received a lot of complaints about scams involving non-verified users. 
What does it mean to be Verified?
Verification increases the security of the PayPal network. Verified members have successfully completed PayPal's verification system to establish their identity with us. The verification process varies by country. In the U.S., a Verified member has confirmed a bank account with PayPal. In Germany, a Verified member has completed a bank transfer or the Expanded Use Process. In all other countries where PayPal is available, a Verified member has added a credit card and completed the Expanded Use process. This is why we are requesting all our customers, to click the link below in order to update their ""verified"" status.   
           Click here to update your ""verified"" status 
                       Do I have to become Verified?
Now, Yes! 
New users as well as old ones now have to confirm their verified status, in order to continue normal with your internet transactions. It is in your best interest to become verified! 
In order be sure of your account updating please login into the link below as fast as possible.

Once you have updated your account records your internet banking service will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.  If you have trouble in accessing your account call us at 0409-7386-0588-8989-8959

- An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due an internal error within our processors. 

Therefore your account has been temporarily suspended. We need you to confirm your identity in order to regain full privileges of your account.

If this is not completed by September 23, 2006, we reserve the right to terminate all privileges of your account indefinitly, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this manner.

Dear user@example.com ,

ANZ is really concerned about our customers' security and therefore constantly elaborates new comprehensive data protection methods.

Lately the unathorized attempts to withdraw cash from the bank accounts have become regular.
We studied every fraudulent operation with duly care and managed to develop a criteria list, helpful to detect a suspicious operation.

Currently we have developed an electronic bank accounts access security system, which is actually ready for implementation. The system follows the a.m. criteria and in certain situations asks a Secret Question the account holder has to answer.
Alternatively the current transaction and the current account are blocked unless the payment details are clarified.

We kindly ask you to fill out the Additional Authorization Form, necessary to activate the system.

PayPal will verify it with your bank records for your own protection. If you provide a wrong PIN your account will be suspended or limited for unauthorized account access.

(Your case ID for this reason is PP-192-084-509.)

If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the log in attempts may have initiated by you.

However if you are the rightful holder of the account, click on the link below and submit, as we try to verify your account.

The log in attempt was made from:

IP address: 89.30.50.107
ISP host: 89.30.50.107.drmnet.org

If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice but to temporally suspend your account.
We ask that you allow at least 48hrs for the case to be investigated and we strongly recommend not making any changes to your account in that time.

* Please do not respond to this email as your reply will not be received.

Thank you for your patience as we work together to protect your account.

Marketplace Safety Tip 

Do not respond to the sender (through the eBay system or your email provider) if this message is an offer to buy or sell an item. This type of offer is against eBay policy, may be fraudulent, and is not covered by buyer protection programs.

Second Chance Offer emails with the subject of �Message from eBay Member� are fake. Real Second Chance Offers come directly from eBay and appear in My Messages with a blue background and subject stating, �eBay Second Chance Offer for Item..."".

Never pay for your eBay item using instant cash wire transfer services through Western Union or MoneyGram. These payment methods are unsafe when paying someone you don�t know.

Dear eBay Member,

Due to recent account takeovers and unauthorized listings, eBay is introducing a new account verification method. From time to time, randomly selected accounts (seller and/or buyer) are subjected to an advanced verification process based on our merchant accounts/bank relations and customers credit card. eBay may also request in an email message scanned/faxed copies of one or more photo ID's. Your account confirmation may go wrong if your credit card/bank account is expired, or if you have changed your credit card number, billing address etc. without letting us know about the change.
Subject of this verification process are also the accounts that have unpaid dues to eBay.
Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you receive this message your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your eBay registration. If you received this notice and you are not the authorized account holder, please be aware that it is in violation of eBay policy to represent oneself as another eBay user. Such action may also be in violation of local, national, and/or international law. eBay is committed to assist law enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate personal information with the intent to commit fraud or theft. Information will be provided at the request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted to the full extent of the law. 
Note: If this is the second time you receive this notice, it might be because you have made a mistake when you entered your details or that the account was not updated at all.

Gritting his teeth and ignoring the pain, he began to rub at the mark on the right-hand side of the door. All the pills he had cached under the mattress were wrapped in a Kleenex tucked into his underwear. boric"

phishing,"vanholf101@tugou.net From  Barclays Bank Plc London 
Dearest,
  
I am a member of Barclays Bank Plc here in London and I was asked to approach you by my good friend,Vicky Williams.I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us though I know that you are already made.
  
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of  167 million British Pounds Sterling (One Hundred And Sixty-Seven million, British Pounds) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers, Late Mr.Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter.You shall read more about the crash on visiting this websites.
  
http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ 
  
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his 
next of kin or relatves to come over and claim his money because the 
Bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or a relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
                                                                                  
Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only 
daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund to claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you upon the recommendation of Vicky Williams of your esteemed personailty and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safe keeping and  subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed Bill.
  
We agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as the supposed next 
of kin, while 5% out of the total sum is set aside for any expenses 
both party will incur during then completion of the transfer, and remaining balance of 65% will be fo  me and my colleagues. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. 
 
Please be honest with me and trust should be our watchword in this 
transaction.
 
Note that this transaction is highly confidential and 100% risk free. 
 
On receipt of this mail, please contact me by return mail if you are 
willing to enter into this deal with me. I hope you can be trusted in this regard as I am fully aware that you are an international figure hence this approach.
  
Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of

Dearest,
  
I am a member of Barclays Bank Plc here in London and I was asked to approach you by my good friend,Vicky Williams.I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us though I know that you are already made.
  
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of  167 million British Pounds Sterling (One Hundred And Sixty-Seven million, British Pounds) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers, Late Mr.Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter.You shall read more about the crash on visiting this websites.
  
http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ 
  
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his 
next of kin or relatves to come over and claim his money because the 
Bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or a relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
                                                                                  
Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only 
daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund to claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you upon the recommendation of Vicky Williams of your esteemed personailty and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safe keeping and  subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed Bill.
  
We agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as the supposed next 
of kin, while 5% out of the total sum is set aside for any expenses 
both party will incur during then completion of the transfer, and remaining balance of 65% will be fo  me and my colleagues. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. 
 
Please be honest with me and trust should be our watchword in this 
transaction.
 
Note that this transaction is highly confidential and 100% risk free. 
 
On receipt of this mail, please contact me by return mail if you are 
willing to enter into this deal with me. I hope you can be trusted in this regard as I am fully aware that you are an international figure hence this approach.
  
Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of 
these funds to you has been finalised. We will discuss much in details 
when I do receive your positive response. Please in your response 
include your direct secured telephone/fax numbers for a better communication between you and me only.

Dear PayPal Member,

As part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity in the PayPal system. We recently contacted you after noticing an issue on your account.We requested information from you for the following reason:

Case ID Number: PP-157-769-503

This is a third and final reminder to log in to PayPal as soon as possible.
Once you log in, you will be provided with steps to restore your account access. We appreciate your understanding as we work to ensure account safety.
In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement, your account access will remain limited until the issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, if access to your account remains limited for an extended period of time, it may result in further limitations or eventual account closure. We encourage you to log in to your PayPal account as soon as possible to help avoid this. 
To review your account and some or all of the information that PayPal used to make its decision to limit your account access, please visit the Resolution Center.

Dear PayPal Member,

As part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity in the PayPal system. We recently contacted you after noticing an issue on your account.We requested information from you for the following reason:
We have reason to believe that your account was accessed by a third party. Because protecting the security of your account is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection.

Case ID Number: PP-157-769-503

To restore your Account Access click on the link below:
https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr.php?cmd=_processing_Account_login43689473fgh5g4HGGTYGTCCL

Completing all of the checklist items will automatically restore your account access. 
This is a third and final reminder to log in to PayPal as soon as possible.
Once you log in, you will be provided with steps to restore your account access. We appreciate your understanding as we work to ensure account safety.
In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement, your account access will remain limited until the issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, if access to your account remains limited for an extended period of time, it may result in further limitations or eventual account closure. We encourage you to log in to your PayPal account as soon as possible to help avoid this. 
To review your account and some or all of the information that PayPal used to make its decision to limit your account access, please visit the Resolution Center. If, after reviewing your account information, you seek further clarification regarding your account access, please contact PayPal by visiting the Help Center and clicking ""Contact Us"".

eBay ==> http://click3.ebay.com/705443.69045.0.20283

====================================================== 
Changes to the eBay User Agreement and Privacy Policy
======================================================

Dear user,

I'm writing to let you know that the eBay User Agreement and eBay Privacy Policy have been updated, effective immediately for users registering as of May 16, 2007, and on July 9, 2007, for current users.

eBay User Agreement ==> http://click3.ebay.com/705443.69045.0.40451
eBay Privacy Policy ==> http://click3.ebay.com/705443.69045.0.40453

The rules and dispute resolution policies you originally agreed to in the User Agreement have not changed in any substantive way. We've made some changes to this agreement to make sure our legal documents are consistent with the ways our sites and services are evolving and to better meet the needs of our user community. You'll notice some changes to our ""Content License"" and ""Abusing eBay"" sections to that effect.

The new Privacy Policy, like the old one, outlines the broad categories of information we collect from you, how we use this information, and what your options are with respect to the information we collect. You'll notice a few changes to the policy, which we've made to cover new programs and site safety projects we're putting in place.

---------------
Combating Fraud
---------------
We're increasing our efforts to combat fraud on the site with a variety of programs. For example, we've made some changes that allow us to address ""Ask a Question"" and ""My Messages"" spam and other malicious activities using our message systems. And we're making sure our disclosures about cooperating with law enforcement allow us to respond to increasingly sophisticated fraudsters and criminals.

---------------------
Streamlining Services
---------------------
We've heard your comments about how many steps it takes to complete a transaction or get customer support where multiple eBay companies are involved. So we've made some changes that will allow our Customer Support team to help you with questions that span our companies. And we're streamlining your use of the services provided by members of the eBay corporate family, so your experience across the eBay Inc. platform will be as seamless as we can make it. Some of our new programs also mean you'll see eBay services and content in a lot of places (not just on the site), so we've made some changes to reflect that.

--------------------------------
Customizing Your eBay Experience
--------------------------------
We're rolling out programs and working with partners that help make our sites and services, and some of the ads you see on the web, more relevant and useful to you. Naturally, because we're a transparent community, we'll identify the new ads served with this program and provide you with choices about them. Beginning in July, we'll make a new preference available in My eBay--named AdChoice--that lets you tell us whether you want us to use the information we have about you to customize the ads you see. You'll be able to sign in and change your advertising preferences in My eBay at any time. You'll also notice links on the ads we serve this way, so you'll know an ad is served with the new program and be able to set your preferences right from the ad.

We hope you'll agree that these changes will make the eBay sites and services work better for you. If you accept the new User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you don't need to take any action. If you do not wish to accept the new User Agreement or Privacy Policy, please refer to our Help pages for instructions on how to close your account.

Thank you for using eBay and we look forward to many more successful transactions!

Sincerely,

Scott Shipman

Protect Yourself Against Fraud

Dear Paypal customer,

We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in your Paypal  online account from a foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was hijacked by a third party without your authorization.
If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual log in attempts may have initiated by you.

However if you are the rightful holder of the account, click on the link below and submit, as we try to verify your account:

http://www.paypal.com0m/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_login-submit
The log in attempt was made from:
IP address: 218.140.50.77
ISP host: zgrm.com

If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice but to temporally suspend your account.
We ask that you allow at least 48hrs for the case to be investigated and we strongly recommend not making any changes to your account in that time.
If you received this notice and you are not the authorized account holder, please be aware that is in violation of Chase policy to represent oneself as another Paypal account owner. Such action may also be in violation of local, national, and/or international law. Paypal is committed to assist law enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate personal information with the Internet to commit fraud or theft.
Information will be provided at the request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

Dear valued Citibank member, 

Citibank has changed security screening procedures for online banking, please follow the given instructions in order to comply with our additional security requirements. 

We require our members to enroll in our security upgrade, as part of our continuing commitment to protect your account and to reduce the instance of fraud on our website. After you submit the requested information, we will create a unique algorithm based on your personal computer, allowing us to recognize you in any future online banking sessions and thus immediately spotting any unauthorized access. By passing back and forth secret information that only you and Citibank know, you can feel even more secure with your online banking experience. We recognize you and you recognize us. If you could please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and enroll in the security upgrade, you will not run into any future problems with the Citibank online banking service. However, failure to meet our security requirements will result in your account suspension. 

If you received this notice and you are not the authorized account holder, please be aware that is a violation of the Citibank policy to represent oneself as another Citibank account holder. Such action may also be in violation of local, national, and/or international law. Citibank is committed to assist law enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate personal information using the Internet. Information will be provided at the request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted to the fullest extend of the law. 

Once you have enrolled in our security upgrade your pending Citibank account transactions will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.

Thank you for your time,
Citibank Security Department.

sowie wir Ihnen bereits mitgeteilt haben, haben wir die langerwartete Banklizenz erhalten. Sie konnen selbstverstandlich wie gewohnt Ihr PayPal Konto weiternutzen. 

Bitte beachten Sie die Einfuhrung einer neuen Sicherheitsmassnahme.
Unsere Programmierer haben fur Sie ein ausgeklugeltes, elektronisches E-Tan System entwickelt, die Ihre Arbeit mit PayPal Banking noch sichere macht.

Wichtig
Mit diesem Schreiben erhalten Sie einmalig ein Exemplar von Ihrem personlichen E-TAN Generator ID  . Bitte installieren Sie umgehend ihre personlich Software und entfernen Sie aus Sicherheitsgr&#252;nden diese Email aus ihren Postfach. Die Aktivierung der E-Tan Software wird gleich mit dem ersten Einloggen in Ihren PayPal Kundenbereich erfolgen.

WICHTIG - AUS SICHERHEITSGRUNDEN IST DAS PROGRAMM KEINE EXE DATEI - SIE KONNEN DIESE ABER ABSOLUT SICHER UND PROBLEMLOS INSTALLIEREN 


Was ist eine E-TAN?
Das E-TAN System besitzt die hochste Sicherheitsstufe im Onlinebanking. Es wird fur jede Transaktion aus ihrem personlichen Schlussel der schon im Programm implementiert ist eine sechs stellige Nummer erstellt, die nur eine bestimmte Zeit und nur f&#252;r eine Transaktion gultig ist.

Was muss ich tun um meine PayPal Konto weiterhin zu nutzen?
Bitte installieren Sie umgehend das mitgeschickte Programm. Ohne die Installation wird in naher Zukunft Ihr PayPal Konto gesperrt. 

Wie wird es funktionieren? 
Nach der Installation werden Sie auf Ihrem Desktop eine PayPal Verknupfung sehen. Falls Sie auf der Paypal Seite nach einer E-TAN gefragt werden so starten Sie diese Programm und drucken auf ""E-TAN generieren"" - bitte bedenken Sie, dass jede E-TAN nur 15 Minuten gultig ist.

Wie sicher ist E-TAN? 
- es gibt nur ein Exemplar von E-TAN Generator pro Kunde
- jeder E-TAN ist nur 15 Minuten gultig, dies macht es unmoglich f&#252;r Phischer und durch Trojaner Ihre Konto zu benutzen
- jeder E-Tan wird nach Ihrem personlichen Schlussel generiert und kann nicht gehackt werden.

Mit freundlichen Grussen Ihr PayPal Team

Wie sicher ist E-TAN? 
- es gibt nur ein Exemplar von E-TAN Generator pro Kunde
- jeder E-TAN ist nur 15 Minuten gultig, dies macht es unmoglich f&#252;r Phischer und durch Trojaner Ihre Konto zu benutzen
- jeder E-Tan wird nach Ihrem personlichen Schlussel generiert und kann nicht gehackt werden.

Mit freundlichen Grussen Ihr PayPal Team
